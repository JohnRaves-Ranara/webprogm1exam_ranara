                <h1>TOKYO IMPERIAL PALACE</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Tokyo Imperial Palace (皇居, Kōkyo, literally 'Imperial Residence') is the main residence of the Emperor of Japan. It is a large park-like area located in the Chiyoda district of the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo and contains several buildings including the main palace (宮殿, Kyūden), some residences of the Imperial Family, an archive, museums and administrative offices. It is built on the site of the old Edo Castle. The total area including the gardens is 1.15 square kilometres (0.44 sq mi). During the height of the 1980s Japanese property bubble, the palace grounds were valued by some to be more than the value of all of the real estate in the state of California.

                <p>
                    Just a few stops south of Shibuya on the Tokyu-Toyoko Line, the trendy residential district of Jiyugaoka is a maze of narrow streets with a European ambience dotted with stylish cafes, bakeries and fashion and interior shops. Those with a sweet tooth will enjoy Sweets Forest, serving a collection of specialist confections from around the world with a cute forest theme. There are plenty of surprises in store, from the Parisian-style streetscapes to La Vita, a miniature version of Venice, with a canal and gondola. If you tire of shopping, ride a Tokyu-Oimachi Line train to nearby Todoroki Ravine Park: a quiet green oasis with a temple, waterfall, burbling river and a dramatic red arched bridge.

The cherry blossoms are usually in bloom during late March and early April and attract large numbers of hanami (cherry blossom viewing) parties.
